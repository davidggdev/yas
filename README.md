Setup proyect and repository

## Getting Started

To use this plugin it is necessary to include the latest version of jQuery 
currently available in [3.x](https://releases.jquery.com/)

You must include/copy the plugin, which is currently located in the directory

    yas-slider/yas-slider.js
  
Finally, the css file must be linked/copy:

    style.css

This is generated from a Sass compiler from the source file style.scss. 
Currently the styles applied are example styles and we try to keep the responsibility for
the size to the developer to apply their own customization styles. 
 

## Running 

To create a new instance it is necessary to create a div with the data-attribute
of [yas-slider] and inside it must contain the images that we want to show in the 
show in the slider:

```html
<div class="my-slider" yas-slider>
    <img src="assets/slider/alain-bonnardeaux-nWMAakp1dKU-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="assets/slider/kentaro-toma-gG917yFiR-U-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="assets/slider/pawel-czerwinski-Sw-m6aYWPFw-unsplash-min.jpg" alt=""> 
</div>
```

It is important to note that currently it only works with img elements only. 
The slider transforms into divs with a series of options and setting 
the image as background-image.

Then in our javascript we will create the instance:


 ```javascript
 $(function($){
    "use strict";

    // yasSlider instance
    $('.my-slider').yasSlider({});
});
 ```

## <a name="Options"></a>Options

It is possible to pass a series of options to configure 
certain attributes of the slider.

Currently it is possible to activate the autorun and define the 
direction and time between slides.
 
Additionally you can customize the elements where to move the slider controls 
to place them where needed. It is important to remember that when activating a 
custom control the default element will no longer have any effect and functionality.

This is an example of how you can customize a slider by replacing 
the predefined controls:

In the js instance:
 ```javascript
 $(function($){
    "use strict";

    // yasSlider instance
    $('.my-slider').yasSlider({
        autorun : {                         // Active autorun slide
            reverse_direction : false,      // Value by default LTR
            speed_interval : 1000           // Speed between slides
        },
        prevElement : $('.prev'),           // Custom html element Pre control
        nextElement : $('.next'),           // Custom html element Next control
        dotsElement : $('.dots')            // Custom html element Dots control
    });
});
 ```

And the html:
```html
<div class="my-slider" yas-slider>
    <img src="assets/slider/alain-bonnardeaux-nWMAakp1dKU-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="assets/slider/kentaro-toma-gG917yFiR-U-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="assets/slider/pawel-czerwinski-Sw-m6aYWPFw-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<div class="my-slider__controls">
    <div class="prev">Prev</div>
    <div class="dots"></div>
    <div class="next">Next</div>
</div>
```

Some sass:
```scss
.my-slider__controls{
    background-color: #121212;
    display: block;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0 auto;
    .prev{
        display: inline-block;
        padding: 7px; 
        color: #c2c2c2;
        vertical-align: top;
        background: #413152;
        font-family: monospace;
        cursor: pointer;
        transition: all .333s linear;
        &:active{
            transform: translateY(2px);
        }
    }
    .next{
        display: inline-block;
        padding: 7px; 
        color: #c2c2c2;
        vertical-align: top;
        background: #413152;
        font-family: monospace;
        cursor: pointer;
        transition: all .133s linear;
        &:active{
            transform: translateY(2px);
        }
    }
    .dots{
        display: inline-block;
        .yas-slider-controls__dots{
            display: inline-block;
            .--dot {
                display: inline-block;
                width: 8px;
                height: 8px;  
                margin: 10px 15px;
                cursor: pointer;
                background-color: #532d53;
                &.--selected {
                    background-color: #b66dff;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
