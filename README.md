# Yas

Yet Another Slider is a jQuery plugin to create sliders with images. 
very basic and made mostly as a test to adapt new coding styles to the 
coding styles

PAY ATTENTION

This software is in a fully alpha version and its stability, performance or 
side effects is not assured.

## Getting Started

To use this plugin it is necessary to include the latest version of jQuery 
currently available in [3.x](https://releases.jquery.com/)

You must include/copy the plugin, which is currently located in the directory

    yas-slider/yas-slider.js
  
Finally, the css file must be linked/copy:

    style.css

This is generated from a Sass compiler from the source file style.scss. 
Currently the styles applied are example styles and we try to keep the responsibility for
the size to the developer to apply their own customization styles. 
 

## Running 

To create a new instance it is necessary to create a div with the data-attribute
of [yas-slider] and inside it must contain the images that we want to show in the 
show in the slider:

```html
<div class="my-slider" yas-slider>
    <img src="assets/slider/alain-bonnardeaux-nWMAakp1dKU-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="assets/slider/kentaro-toma-gG917yFiR-U-unsplash-min.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="assets/slider/pawel-czerwinski-Sw-m6aYWPFw-unsplash-min.jpg" alt=""> 
</div>
```

Then in our javascript we will create the instance:


 ```javascript
 $(function($){
    "use strict";

    // yasSlider instance
    $('.my-slider').yasSlider({});
});
 ```
